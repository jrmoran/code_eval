// # Fizz Buzz
// ## Description:
//
// Players generally sit in a circle. The player designated to go first says
// the number "1", and each player thenceforth counts one number in turn.
// However, any number divisible by 'A' e.g. three is replaced by the word
// fizz and any divisible by 'B' e.g. five by the word buzz. Numbers divisible
// by both become fizz buzz. A player who hesitates or makes a mistake is
// either eliminated.
//
// Write a program that prints out the the pattern generated by such a scenario
// given the values of 'A'/'B' and 'N' which are read from an input text file.
//
// The input text file contains three space delimited numbers i.e. A, B, N.
// The program should then print out the final series of numbers using 'F'
// for fizz, 'B' for 'buzz' and 'FB' for fizz buzz.
//
// ## Input sample:
// Your program should read an input file (provided on the command line)
// which contains multiple newline separated lines. Each line will contain 3
// numbers which are space delimited. The first number is first number to
// divide by ('A' in this example), the second number is the second number to
// divide by ('B' in this example) and the third number is where you should
// count till ('N' in this example). You may assume that the input file is
// formatted correctly and is the numbers are valid positive integers.e.g.
//
//      3 5 10
//      2 7 15
//
// ## Output sample:
// Print out the series 1 through N replacing numbers divisible by 'A' by F,
// numbers divisible by 'B' by B and numbers divisible by both as 'FB'. Since
// the input file contains multiple sets of values, your output will print out
// one line per set. Ensure that there are no trailing empty spaces on each line
// you print.e.g.
//
//      1 2 F 4 B F 7 8 F B
//      1 F 3 F 5 F B F 9 F 11 F 13 FB 15
